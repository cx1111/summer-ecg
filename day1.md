# Day 1 - Programming Concepts and Linux Utilities

## Specific Tasks/Questions

- Using the terminal:
  - View the contents of a directory
    - Including hidden files
    - Show file sizes in human readable format
  - View the current working directory's location
  - What is the full path of your home directory?
  - Change to another directory
  - Create a directory
  - Move a file to another directory
  - Rename a file
  - Delete a file
  - Delete a directory
  - Perform actions as the super user
  - View the help page of a Linux command
  - Make a symbolic link
  - Explain the importance of the various `bin` directories
  - Explain the use of the PATH environment variable
  - Show the PATH environment variable
  - Show the location of an executable to be called. ie. If you typed 'python', where is the python executable?
  - Append a directory containing executables to your PATH variable.

- What are source code and machine code?
- What is a compiled vs an interpreted instance of a language?
- Why is it technically wrong to say that a programming language is compiled or interpreted? What do people mean when they say this?
- What is python? What is the executable located in `/usr/bin/python`?
- Why are python virtual environments important?
- Create a virtual environment with the python2.7 interpreter, and another with python3.5.
- Activate/deactivate the virtual environment
- Use pip to download a package in your virtual environment (numpy, wfdb, jupyter)
- Show where the python interpreter is for your virtual environment
- Perform task 1 in the README.md file. Write your code in a source file. Run the code in the source file.
